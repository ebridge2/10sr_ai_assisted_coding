# Rule 10: Refine Code Incrementally with Focused Objectives

Once you have working, tested code, resist the temptation to ask AI to "improve my codebase." Instead, approach refinement incrementally with clear, focused objectives. Be explicit about what aspect you want to improve: performance optimization, code readability, error handling, modularity, or adherence to specific design patterns. When you recognize that refinement is needed but can't articulate the specific approach (for instance, you know certain logic should be extracted into a separate function but aren't sure how), use AI to help you formulate concrete objectives before implementing changes. Describe what you're trying to achieve and ask the AI to suggest specific refactoring strategies or design patterns that would accomplish your goal, applying the same mindsets delineated in Rules 1 - 9 to help you along the way.

AI excels at identifying opportunities for refactoring and abstraction, such as recognizing repeated code that should be extracted into reusable functions or methods, and detecting poor programming patterns like deeply nested conditionals, overly long functions, tight coupling between components, sloppy or inconsistent variable naming conventions, and other poor patterns. When requesting refinements, specify the goal (e.g., "extract the data validation logic into a separate function" rather than "make this better") and verify each change against your tests (or, improvingimprove your testing as you iterateall together to reflect  the latest updates and improvements) before moving to the next improvement. This focused approach prevents the AI from making changes that, while technically sound, don't align with your project's architectural decisions. Note that AI can inadvertently break previously working code or degrade performance while making stylistic improvements. Always test thoroughly after each incremental change, and revert if the "improvement" introduces problems or doesn't provide clear benefits.
